The Social Network API

## Description

This API provides the essential features for a social networking web application, enabling users to express their thoughts, respond to their friends' posts, and manage their friend connections. The application utilizes Express.js for handling routes and a MongoDB database, with the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) for data management. Instead of pre-populating the database with seed data, users have the flexibility to input their own information using tools like Insomnia or Postman following API installation.

# Installation

To run this application, you will need to add your user and password into an .env file for security purposes, then run the following command:

```
npm i
```

Once you have done that, you will need to run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

Now you test,create,edit and delete data using postman or insomnia.
